/**
 * A RowData object is one row in the GUI.  The very first row in the
 * GUI is the "root" row.  Each row can have 0 or more child rows.
 * A row has an "attributePath", which is how a RowData object defines
 * the attribute that it is describing.  For example:
 *
 *      epochGroups.epoch.label == "Test 21"
 *
 * is describing an attributePath to the label attribute, and says
 * that we are looking for Epochs whose label attribute is "Test 21".
 *
 * You can ask a RowData object whether it contains a legal value
 * by calling the containsLegalValue() method.  We can make the
 * containsLegalValue() code more clever if we want to catch more
 * user errors before the user attempts to use the PQL string that
 * s/he is creating.
 * 
 * TODO: Perhaps change the structure a bit so the root row is NOT a
 * RowData object?  It really is a bit of a different thing given that
 * it is used to set the Class Under Qualification.
 *
 * TODO: Perhaps change how the "is null" and "is not null" values are
 * handled.  Right now, I set the attributeOperator to be "is null" or
 * "is not null".  But, I also have to have the last Attribute on the
 * RowData's attributePath be the Attribute.IS_NULL or IS_NOT_NULL value.
 * This seems a bit redundant.  The problem is, I need the Attribute on
 * the path in order to have the comboBox that holds "is null" etc. be created.
 * So, maybe we should not also store that information in the attributeOperator
 * member data?
